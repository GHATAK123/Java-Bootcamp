/* Applet's Life Cycle
JVM on the user's machine creates an instance of the applet class and invokes various methods during the applet's life time.
Four methods in the Applet class give you the framework on which you can build any Applet application.

1.init() 
2.start()
3.stop()
4.destroy()

paint():It is under start function,but not a part of a applet life cycle.
